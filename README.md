# SquareCreator

## Description
This Java program defines a `Square` class to create and manipulate square objects. It compares the areas of two squares and determines if they are equal. The project demonstrates fundamental object-oriented programming concepts such as constructors, method overriding (`toString()` and `equals()`), and calculating the area of a square.

## Requirements
- Java 21.0.2 or later

## Usage
To run the program, compile the `SquareCreatorApp.java` and `Square.java` files and execute the `SquareCreatorApp` class. The program will create two `Square` objects, print their side lengths and areas, and compare their areas.

### Example Output
Square 1: Side length: 10 Area: 100 Square 2: Side length: 4 Area: 16 Are the areas equal? false

### Key Features:
- **`Square` Class**: Contains methods for creating a square, calculating its area, and comparing two squares.
- **`equals()` Method**: Compares the areas of two square objects.
- **`toString()` Method**: Provides a string representation of a square's side length and area.

### Methods:
- `getSideLength()`: Returns the side length of the square.
- `calculateArea()`: Calculates and returns the area of the square.
- `equals(Square otherSquare)`: Compares the areas of two squares.
- `toString()`: Returns a string representation of the square's dimensions.
